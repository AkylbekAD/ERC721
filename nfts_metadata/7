  "description": "The Lee-Enfield is a bolt-action rifle that was the main service rifle of the British Empire and Commonwealth during the first half of the 20th century from its adoption in 1895 to 1957. A redesign of the earlier Lee-Metford rifle, the Lee-Enfield replaced the earlier Martini-Henry, Martini-Enfield and Lee-Metford rifles. Featuring an easier and faster bolt operation than the Mauser Gewehr 98, it also featured a detachable magazine, a very advanced and modern feature for its time.",
